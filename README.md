## General info
ZenDoc is a Healthcare web application that bridges the gap between appointments. Users are able to track their mental health by answering a daily questionnaire along with a video submission. This allows their doctor to track their progress in between appointments, which will lead to a more accurate analysis of their patients' condition. This will revolutionize the Healthcare industry with more precise data that will increase the accuracy of diagnoses.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* React
* Node
* Firebase
* Figma 

## Functionality
<b />

* Login Page - demonstrates Google's user authentication feature from Firebase that allows users to login/register with their Gmail credentials
* Home Page - welcomes the user by their name associated with their Gmail account, displays a weekly calendar that shows daily submissions when clicked, a daily form questionnaire, a video record button that routes the user to the video submission page, a submit form button that submits the daily questionnaire and a functional logout button
* Video Submission Page - displays a video feature that allows a user to record and save their journal video submission, a back button to traverse back to the Main page, and a functional logout button
* Account Page - displays users account information along with their primary care providers info

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
